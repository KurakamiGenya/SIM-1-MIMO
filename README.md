## File Descriptions

### MATLAB Scripts (.m)
- `run_all_algorithms.m`: Master script to run all optimization algorithms (GD, PSO, PSO-TVIW) and generate comparison plots.
- `test_SIM.m`: Implementation of the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm for SIM-MIMO optimization.
- `test_SIM_PSO.m`: Implementation of the Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm (constant inertia weight).
- `test_SIM_PSO_TVIW.m`: Implementation of PSO with Time-Varying Inertia Weight (PSO-TVIW).
- `demo_PSO.m`: A simplified and faster version of the PSO algorithm for demonstration purposes.
- `test_max.m`: Script to calculate the theoretical optimal capacity (upper bound) for reference.
- `Plot_SIM.m`: Plots comparison results (NMSE and Capacity) for GD, PSO, and PSO-TVIW vs the number of TX-SIM layers.
- `compare_results.m`: Loads results and creates comparison plots for Spectral Efficiency and NMSE between different algorithms.
- `plot_convergence.m`: Generates plots showing the convergence history (Sum Rate vs Iterations) of the algorithms.
- `plot_performance_vs_time.m`: Generates a scatter plot comparing performance (Sum Rate) vs execution time for the algorithms.

### MATLAB Figures (.fig)
- `convergence_comparison.fig`: MATLAB figure showing the convergence profiles of GD, PSO, and PSO-TVIW (generated by `plot_convergence.m`).
- `performance_vs_time.fig`: MATLAB figure showing the performance vs execution time trade-off (generated by `plot_performance_vs_time.m`).
